Welcome to the DLI Edge AI and Robotics Teaching Kit lab solutions repository. The kit and associated labs/solutions are developed jointly by NVIDIA, University of Oxford and University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC).

## System Requirements and Environment Setup

#### Jetson Nano and Jetbot Hardware
The [Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-nano/education-projects/) and a modern host computer are the minimum hardware requirements to leverage the Teaching Kit content. Please see *Lecture 1.4 – Introduction to Jetson Nano* for instructions on unboxing and setting up the Jetson Nano, as well as setting up your Linux environment to connect to the labs.

Teaching Kit educators are eligible to apply for Jetson Nano grants via the [NVIDIA Academic Hardware Grant Program](https://mynvidia.force.com/HardwareGrant/s/Application) when the rolling application window is open.

**NVIDIA and SparkFun Electronics have collaborated to offer exclusive Jetson Nano purchasing opportunities for Teaching Kit educators in qualifying countries. Please email NVDLI@nvidia.com with the subject line "Jetson Nanos for Teaching Kit Educators" for more information on how to purchase Jetson Nanos for your courses through this exclusive program!**

A [JetBot Kit](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetbot-ai-robot-kit/) is also required for Module 4 – Autonomous Robotics. See *Lecture 4.2 – Teaching Machines to Act* for more information.


## Jupyter Notebooks
Jupyter Notebooks are open-source web applications that allows creation and sharing of documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. They provide a unique way for students to interact with developing their lab solutions for the Edge AI and Robotics Teaching Kit. More information, links to communities and documentation about Jupyter notebooks can be found at [jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org/).

## Lab Instructional Documents
The `instructions` folder found in each module’s `Labs` folder in the Teaching Kit `.zip` download file contain the lab instructional documents, interactive notebooks, and other associated files and data sets for the given lab. Instructional documents come in `.doc` format for ease of use and modification. The interactive notebooks come in `.ipynb` (Jupyter notebook) format, as well as raw `.py` (Python), and `.html` file formats again for ease of use and modification for your course.

## Lab Solutions
The `solutions` folder found in each module's `Labs` folder in th this repo usually contains at least one example implementation of approaches to solving the lab provided as `.html`, `.py` (Python) and `.ipynb` (Jupyter notebook) files. Some associated data sets are also found in the `solutions` folder. Note not all labs have solutions files as they are simply notebooks for the students to walk through and execute. 

Each of these files usually begin with a description of the lab, objectives, prerequisites, and detailed instructions. As mentioned, some of the notebooks have a separate solution “version” found in this repo that contains solution code that you will not want to provide students directly.

## Cloning and Accessing the Lab Solutions

To clone the lab solutions on your machine and, for example, access Module 2 solutions:
```
    git clone git@bitbucket.org:nvidia-dli/edge-ai-and-robotics-teaching-kit-labs.git
    cd Module 2 - Vision Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
```

## NVIDIA DLI Online Courses and Certificate Opportunities

The NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) Teaching Kit includes links to free online DLI courses – **a value of up to $90 per person per course**. DLI training reinforces deep learning concepts presented in the Teaching Kits and teaches students how to apply those concepts to end-to-end projects. Through built-in assessments, students can earn certifications that prove subject matter competency and can be leveraged for professional career growth. Each course presents a self-paced learning environment with access to a GPU-accelerated workstation in the cloud. All you students need is a web browser and Internet connection to get started. **Although these courses are designed to be taken online, you are free to administer them to your students in a live setting as well.**

The recommended DLI course (with certification) for students learning through the Edge AI and Robotics Teaching Kit is **[Getting Started with AI on Jetson Nano](https://courses.nvidia.com/courses/course-v1:DLI+S-RX-02+V2/about)**.

The Teaching Kit's [online syllabus](https://developer.nvidia.com/edge-ai-robotics-syllabus) suggests students take sections of this course during specific modules or upon near-completion of your university semester course. It also suggests where other online DLI courses can be used as labs throughout your university course.

*To enable these or any other courses for your students, please send an email to NVDLI@nvidia.com with subject line “Edge AI and Robotics Teaching Kit Online Course Access”. You will then receive information about how to give free access to your students.*

Detailed descriptions of all available DLI courses can be found at [www.nvidia.com/dli](https://www.nvidia.com/dli).

## About the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI)
The NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) offers hands-on training for developers, datascientists, and researchers looking to solve challenging problems with deep learning and accelerated computing. Through built-in assessments, students can earn certifications thatprove subject matter competency and can be leveraged for professional career growth.

#### Become a Certified Jetson AI Ambassador
This certification is for educators and recognizes competency in teaching AI on Jetson using a hands-on, project-based assessment and an interview with the NVIDIA team. This track is ideal for educators or instructors who want to be fully prepared to teach AI to their students. For more information and how to apply visit [Jetson AI Courses and Certifications](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/jetson-ai-certification-programs).

#### Attend Instructor-led Training
In addition to online, self-paced courses, DLI offers all fundamentals and industry-specific courses as in-person workshops led by DLI-certified instructors. View upcoming workshops near you at [www.nvidia.com/dli](https://www.nvidia.com/dli).
